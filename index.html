        </ul>

        <h2>4. How Your Financial Data is Stored</h2>
        <p>
          All financial data you create in SpendWise is stored locally on your 
          device and is never shared with us or any third parties, including AdMob. 
          This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Categories:</strong> Custom expense and income categories
            you create
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accounts:</strong> Your financial accounts information
          </li>
          <li><strong>Budgets:</strong> Budget limits and tracking data</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Records:</strong> All transaction records (expenses and
            income)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis Data:</strong> Calculated statistics and
            visualizations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is stored exclusively in your device's local storage and is
          never transmitted to any external servers or third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Backup and Export Features</h2>
        <p>
          SpendWise provides backup and export functionality to help you secure
          your data:
        </p>

        <h3>Backup Feature</h3>
        <p>
          When you create a backup, all your data is exported to a file that is
          saved on your device. You have complete control over where this backup
          file is stored and how it is shared. The backup file remains on your
          device unless you choose to transfer it elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h3>Export Feature</h3>
        <p>
          The export feature allows you to extract your financial records in
          standard formats (such as CSV or JSON) for use in other applications
          or for your own record-keeping. Exported files are saved locally to
          your device, and you decide what to do with them.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <strong>Important:</strong> If you choose to store backup or exported
          files in cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) or share
          them with others, those services' privacy policies will apply. We
          recommend encrypting sensitive financial data before storing it in any
          cloud service.
        </div>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Your financial data in SpendWise is protected because it operates 
          completely offline:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your financial data is not exposed to internet-based security threats</li>
          <li>
            No data breaches of your financial information can occur from our 
            servers (because we don't have any)
          </li>
          <li>Your device's security features protect your data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend that you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep your device secured with a password, PIN, or biometric lock
          </li>
          <li>Regularly create backups of your data</li>
          <li>Store backup files in secure locations</li>
          <li>Be cautious when sharing exported data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
        
        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
